MVC (Model-View-Controller) in Backend:

MVC is an architectural pattern for designing backend projects. It divides the application into three components:

Model: Manages data and business logic.
View: Presents data to users and handles the user interface.( view here is our routes section)
Controller: Intermediary between Model and View, processes user inputs.

Benefits:
Separation of Concerns
Modularity
Testability


we can have all the configuration in config.env file which is under data folder 
and we can access these configuration anywhere in the project using 

process.env.PORT
but we have to configure the configuration for that  we need dotenv module and set it like below


import { config } from "dotenv";
// Configuring environment variables from the 'config.env' file in the 'data' folder
config({
  path: "./data/config.env",
});
